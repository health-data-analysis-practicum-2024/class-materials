## Preliminaries

First load the packages that we will be using in this document:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # core group of tidyverse packages
library(kableExtra)  # to make nice tables
library(broom)  # for tidy model summaries
library(gtsummary) # to create nice summary tables
```

## Module 1: Smoking and the risk of disease

Questions of interest:

* **Question 1.1: ** How does the risk of disease compare for smokers and otherwise similar non-smokers?

<center>
![](Q1_dag.png){width=500px}
</center>

* **Queston 1.2: ** Does the contribution of smoking to the risk of disease vary by sex or socio-economic status (SES)?

<center>
![](Q2_dag.png){width=500px}
</center>

To address each question we want:

* A data display (graph or table)
* A statistical analysis (with interprepration)

We will answer these questions using data from the National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES)

## Review of propensity scores and how they alleviate confounding

> There is **confounding** in the effect of a treatment $Z$ (e.g. smoking) on an outcome variable $Y$ (e.g. disease status) if we fail to compare **otherwise similar** units and as a result attribute to $Z$ what is **actually caused by factors $X$** that differ between the $Z=0$ and $Z=1$ observations.

We often display this confounding using a directed acyclic graph (DAG):
![Confounding DAG](confounding_dag.png)

Propensity scores allow us to break the link between our confounders and our *treatment*, removing the first connection in this DAG. Within a propensity score group, there is no association between the counfounding variables and the treatment, and therefore confounding has been controlled.

```{r , echo = FALSE}
nmes_data <- read_csv("module_1/nmesUNPROC.csv")

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(eversmk = factor(eversmk, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Never smoker", "Ever smoker")),
         lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No LC", "LC")),
         chd5 = factor(chd5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No CHD", "CHD")),
         female = factor(female, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Male", "Female")),
         current = factor(current, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not current smoker", "Current smoker")),
         former = factor(former, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not former smoker", "Former smoker")),
         beltuse = factor(beltuse, levels= c("1", "2", "3"), labels = c("Rare", "Some", "Almost always")),
         educate = factor(educate, levels= c("1", "2", "3", "4"), labels = c("College grad", "Some college", "HS grad", "Other")),
         marital = factor(marital, levels= c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"), labels = c("Married", "Widowed", "Divorced", "Separated", "Never married")),
         poor = factor(poor, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not poor", "Poor"))
         )

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(lc5 == "LC" | chd5 == "CHD", 
                          levels=c(FALSE,TRUE), 
                          labels=c("No MSCD", "MSCD")))

```

```{r}
# fit propensity score model
prop_model_2 <- glm(eversmk ~ age + female + marital + educate, family = binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data, na.action = na.exclude)

# calculate propensity scores:
nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(ps_2 = predict(prop_model_2, type = "response"))

# calculate propensity score quintiles:
ps_quintiles_2 <- quantile(nmes_data$ps_2, probs=c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1), na.rm=TRUE)  # need na.rm=TRUE to deal with missing values

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(ps_strata_2 = cut(ps_2, breaks=ps_quintiles_2, include.lowest=TRUE))


```

Before stratifying by propensity score groups, we can see clear associations between the counfounders and the treatment:
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  tbl_summary(by = eversmk, 
              include = c(age, female, marital, educate))
```

Are the ever smokers and never smokers "similar"?  How are they different? How can these differences cause problems when we compare disease risk between ever smokers and never smokers?

Now, instead, let's compare ever smokers and never smokers just among the **lowest propensity score quintile**:
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  filter(ps_strata_2 == "[0.18,0.345]") %>%
  tbl_summary(by = eversmk, 
              include = c(age, female, marital, educate))
```

Here, we can see that the association between our confounders and our treatment (how the distribution of the counfounders varies comparing never-smokers to ever-smokers) is strongly attenuated.

This is true within any of the propensity score strata.

For example, among the **fifth propensity score quintile**:
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  filter(ps_strata_2 == "(0.659,0.858]") %>%
  tbl_summary(by = eversmk, 
              include = c(age, female, marital, educate))
```

In general, within a propensity score quintile group, the distribution of confounding variables is balanced between the ever and never smoker groups.  So when we compare ever smokers to never smokers within one of these groups, we can say the ever smokers are similar to the never smokers with respect to these variables, i.e., there is no association between the counfounders and the *treatment* (smoking).

This idea is similar to that of a randomized controlled trial, where we randomly assign participants to treatment groups and the randomization assures that all characteristics are balanced between the treatment groups.  Here we are constructing those balanced groups through the use of propensity scores.

Hopefully this helps clarify exactly how propensity scores work to alleviate confounding.


## Discussion of propensity scores verses logistic regression for Question 1-1

In your small groups, take 20 minutes to discuss the results of your propensity score analysis and multivariable logistic regression to answer Question 1.1.  Feel free to refer to the [Piazza thread](https://piazza.com/class/lrh8j0ur7id7kt/post/32){target="_blank"} with all student results, but below you can find pasted some of the student comments comparing the two analysis methods: 

* The results of my multivariable logistic regression and my propensity score analysis were very different. I think that overall the idea of a propensity score acting similarly to a randomized control trial in the sense that within the quintile group, each confounder is supposed to be balanced across eversmk status is very useful. However, within each of my quintile group results, the confounders didnâ€™t seem very balanced to me; which ultimately made me prefer my original multivariable logistic regression results more.

* I was surprised by the drastic difference in results for the two different analyses. I expected them to be similar, but it makes sense that the differences in grouping the data would yield different results. I like the results from the propensity score better than the logistic regression because it more resembles a randomized control trial and think it would yield a more accurate result 

* Comparing the two methods, there seems to be a large difference between the odds ratio for smoking status with MSCD status. The propensity score analysis yielded an OR of 1.537, while the logistic multivariable regression yielded an OR of 2.189. I feel as though the propensity score analysis is likely more reliable, as it better controls for age, which had such a large range that comparison was forced between small groups when it was held constant. 

* I think that my propensity score model is a better predictor of the risk of developing an MSCD based on smoking status, as it helps mitigate confounding by taking into account variables such as sex, age, and education level. 

* A propensity score analysis is favored over our prior logistic regression due to its standardized approach, employing quintiles, which systematically addresses potential confounding variables.

* The results of the multivariable linear regression model and the propensity score analysis were not in agreement. This form of stratification seems to be very useful but I am sure there is a better method than the one I used for quintile groups.

* Between these two models I would prefer the second model to answer question 1.1. This is because the age group I created for model 1 was arbitrary so the grouping is not indicative of 'similar' smokers and non smokers. The propensity score does a better job of grouping similar individuals. 


Discuss the following questions:

(1) How do the multivariable logistic regression results change depending on which adjustment variables are included in the model?  Do you think this is a problem?  Do these differences change the answer to Question 1.1?

(2) How do the results from the propensity score analyses compare to those from logistic regression?  Do you think any differences in the results are a problem?  Do these differences change the answer to Question 1.1?

(3) What are some of the pros/cons for each analysis method (logistic regression vs. propensity score analysis)?  In particular, look at the width of the confidence intervals for the estimated odds ratios comparing smokers to non-smokers for the multi-variate logistic regression vs the propensity score models. Which method do you prefer in this case, and why?

(4) In the student results, was it always clear which variables were included as adjustment variables in the logistic regression model?  Was is always clear which variables were included as adjustment variables in the propensity score analysis?  If not, what are suggestions for either the table of results or the write-up that could make this clear?

(5) Were they any interpretations of results (for either model) that you found particularly well done?  What were the characteristics of those interpretations?

(6) What are your lingering questions about propensity scores?

## R notes based Assignment 1-3

Just a few notes this week: including numbers from your regression results directly into the text in R Markdown and writing numerate sentences when summarizing your results.  Reminder: you should also feel free to ask questions on Piazza if there is something you would like us to help you learn how to do!

### Recoding the data
```{r}
nmes_data <- read_csv("module_1/nmesUNPROC.csv")

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(eversmk = factor(eversmk, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Never smoker", "Ever smoker")),
         lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No LC", "LC")),
         chd5 = factor(chd5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No CHD", "CHD")),
         female = factor(female, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Male", "Female")),
         current = factor(current, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not current smoker", "Current smoker")),
         former = factor(former, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not former smoker", "Former smoker")),
         beltuse = factor(beltuse, levels= c("1", "2", "3"), labels = c("Rare", "Some", "Almost always")),
         educate = factor(educate, levels= c("1", "2", "3", "4"), labels = c("College grad", "Some college", "HS grad", "Other")),
         marital = factor(marital, levels= c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"), labels = c("Married", "Widowed", "Divorced", "Separated", "Never married")),
         poor = factor(poor, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not poor", "Poor"))
         )

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(lc5 == "LC" | chd5 == "CHD", 
                          levels=c(FALSE,TRUE), 
                          labels=c("No MSCD", "MSCD")))
```

### Propensity scores with smaller groups

Why does it not really make a difference if you use logistic regression or propensity score groups when you have only two binary variables?

First, we use logistic regression to model the log odds of ever smoking based on female and poor:
```{r}
prop_model <- glm(eversmk ~ female + poor, family = binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data, na.action = na.exclude)

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(ps = predict(prop_model, type = "response"))


ggplot(data = nmes_data) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x=ps, y=disease, color=eversmk), alpha = .4) 
```

Note that propensity score groups are completely determined by the female and poor variables:
```{r}
ggplot(data = nmes_data) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x=ps, y=disease, color=female, shape = poor), alpha = .4) 

```

If we want to have at least four propensity score groups, this means that we would be splitting people into the exact groups they would be split into by the sex/poverty status variables, not providing any benefit. 


### In-line code (including code in within the text)

In your written interpretations of your regression results, you all refer to values that are also presented in your tables of coefficients or odds ratios.  Instead of copying/pasting or typing these numbers into the text, you can refer directly to the values in your tables within your text.  This is called "in-line" code, and it is done using: tick r.

For example, suppose we created the following table of logistic regression results:
```{r}
my_model <- glm(disease ~ eversmk + age + female, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data)

my_model_results <- tidy(my_model, 
                         exponentiate = TRUE,
                         conf.int = TRUE)

my_model_results$term <- c("Intercept", "Ever smoker", "Age (years)", "Female")

my_model_results
```

NOTE: A couple of you said you couldn't figure out how to rename the variables shown in the table. See example above for how to do it.

And we displayed it nicely in the following table:
```{r}
my_model_results %>%
  filter(term != "Intercept") %>% # remove the row with the intercept
  mutate(conf.int = paste0("(", round(conf.low, 2), ", ", round(conf.high, 2), ")")) %>% # combine the CI terms together into nice format 
  select(Variable = term, `Odds Ratio` = estimate, `p-value` = p.value, `95% Confidence Interval` = conf.int) %>% # select only the columns we want, rearrange columns, and change names
  kable(format = "pipe",
        digits = 3,
        align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"))
```

In the text, we might interpret the results as:

Holding age and sex constant, the odds of having a major smoking-caused disease among smokers is 2.2 times the odds of having a disease for non-smokers.

**If we don't want to type out this number, we could use in-line R code instead:** In our table of results (`my_model_results`), the odds ratio for smoking is stored in the `estimate` column where `term == "Ever smoker"`.  We can access that specific table location with:
```{r}
my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(estimate) %>% pull()
```

Here the `pull()` function is used to give a single value rather than return a table.  We can then put this value within our text as `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(estimate) %>% pull()`.  When the report is knit, the results of this code are inserted into the text.

When inserting numbers into text, `format()` is your friend. It allows you to set the number of digits so you donâ€™t print to a ridiculous degree of accuracy.  We can also add `big.mark = ","` to make numbers easier to read or specify that we do not want to use scientific notation here:
```{r}
format(3452345, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")
format(0.12358124331, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")
format(9e-2, digits = 3, scientific = FALSE)
```

So we could re-write our results as:

Holding age and sex constant, the odds of having a major smoking-caused disease among smokers is `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(estimate) %>% pull() %>% format(digits = 2)` times the odds of having a disease for non-smokers.

### Stating numerate results

When writing up your results, be sure to be numerate!  This means including actual values of odds ratios in your write-up (see above), but also means to include information about the statistical significance as well, with supporting evidence like a confidence interval of p-value.  For example, we could improve our intepretation above in a couple of ways:

Holding age and sex constant, the odds of having a major smoking-caused disease among smokers is `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(estimate) %>% pull() %>% format(digits = 2)` times the odds of having a disease for non-smokers (p = `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(p.value) %>% pull() %>% format(digits = 2, scientific = FALSE)`).

OR

Holding age and sex constant, the odds of having a major smoking-caused disease among smokers is `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(estimate) %>% pull() %>% format(digits = 2)` times the odds of having a disease for non-smokers (95% CI for odds ratio: `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(conf.low) %>% pull() %>% format(digits = 2)` to `r my_model_results %>% filter(term == "Ever smoker") %>% select(conf.high) %>% pull() %>% format(digits = 2)`).


### Adding figure captions and other graph tips

We can add figure captions to our plots in R Markdown.  This code chunk creates a string that will be used below as a figure caption:
```{r}
figcap.nmes = paste0("Figure 1: Scatter plot of log10 medical expenditures vs age for n=", nrow(nmes_data), " observations")
```

We can then add this figure caption to our code chunk header using the `fig.cap` argument in the code chunk header:
```{r, fig.cap = figcap.nmes}
nmes_data %>%
  mutate(log10exp = log10(totalexp)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = log10exp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red")
``` 

Note that we can use options like `include = FALSE`, `echo = FALSE`, and `message = FALSE` in our code chunk headers to control what is printed out in the actual report.  So if we just want to include the graph and not the code for either the graph or the caption we could set `include = FALSE` for the caption definition chunk and `echo = FALSE` for the plot chunk.  We can also supress the message about `geom_smooth` by including `message = FALSE` in our chunk for the graph.

Then we **just** get the graph in our report while hiding all the code that went into creating it!

```{r include = FALSE}
figcap.nmes = paste0("Figure 1: Scatter plot of log10 medical expenditures vs age for n=", nrow(nmes_data), " observations")
```

```{r, fig.cap = figcap.nmes, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
nmes_data %>%
  mutate(log10exp = log10(totalexp)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = log10exp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red")
``` 

## Interpreting propensity score results

Suppose we calculate propensity scores based on **age** and **sex**:
```{r}
# fit propensity score model: trt ~ confounders
prop_model <- glm(eversmk ~ age + female, family = binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data, na.action = na.exclude)

# calculate propensity scores:
nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(ps = predict(prop_model, type = "response"))

# calculate propensity score quintiles:
ps_quintiles <- quantile(nmes_data$ps, probs=c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1), na.rm=TRUE)

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(ps_strata = cut(ps, breaks=ps_quintiles, include.lowest=TRUE))

# model log odds of disease from smoking and ps quintiles
model_ps_strata <- glm(disease ~ eversmk + ps_strata, family = binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data)
summary(model_ps_strata)

# transform log OR to OR
exp(coef(model_ps_strata))
```

We would interpret the coefficient for `eversmk` as follows.  We *do not* need to interpret the coefficients for the propensity score quintiles because these variables are just there for adjustment purposes are are not the relationship of interest!

## Looking ahead to Wednesday: Effect modification

On Wednesday we will finally consider **Queston 1.2: ** Does the contribution of smoking to the risk of disease vary by sex or socio-economic status (SES)?

<center>
![](Q2_dag.png){width=500px}

</center>

An **effect modification** (or **interaction**) is present when the relationship between a predictor of interest and the outcome varies by the level (subgroup) of another variable.

For example, if we thought the effect of smoking on disease was different (larger or smaller) for males than it is for females, we would want to consider a model that allows sex to *modify* the relationship between smoking and disease.

### Discussion: How can we investigate whether sex *modifies* the relationship between smoking and disease using a data display?

Let's start with a display similar to what we've already considered for Question 1.1:

```{r}
my_table <- nmes_data %>%
  count(female, eversmk, disease) %>%
  group_by(female, eversmk) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(disease == "MSCD")

my_table %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = eversmk, y = prop), stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ female)
```

What, if anything, does this graph suggest about whether there's a different relationship between smoking and disease for male compared to female individuals?


## Assignment 1.4: Final Module 1 Report
